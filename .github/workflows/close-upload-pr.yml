            This PR has been automatically closed because it modifies the \`upload/\` folder.

            The \`upload/\` folder is intended for **personal use only** in your own fork. It should not be merged into the main repository.

            **How to use the upload folder correctly:**
            1. Fork this repository
            2. Add your bootanimation files to the \`upload/\` folder in your fork
            3. Run the GitHub Actions workflow in your fork
            4. Download the built module from your fork's Actions artifacts

            If you have a different contribution (bug fix, new template, etc.), please open a new PR without changes to the \`upload/\` folder.

            Thank you for your understanding!`
